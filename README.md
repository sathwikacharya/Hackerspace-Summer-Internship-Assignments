# Hackerspace-Summer-Internship-Assignments
As part of Hackerspace PESU's summer internship for 5 weeks, I was taught and given a strong foundation on the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing and on how to get started with this rapidly evolving domain. There was an assignment for the first two weeks followed by two quizzes as part of the evaluation scheme. The same can be seen in this repository.

P.S : I will be soon adding the pdf of the question set for the above mentioned assignments
